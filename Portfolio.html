        <h2>Process Analysis 2</h2> 
        <img src = "img/waterBottle.png" alt = "image of ongoing design process for a water purification artifact to provide relief for victims of disasters and war">

        <h3>Analysis and Explanation</h3>
            <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO)
                that provided relief for victims of disasters and war. It required a focus on an uncommon material and common material that was drawn from a hat, and incorporated into the design. 
                With function and form being a main aspect into the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer in mind. My role 
                was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints
                in the involvement of materials. 
            </p>
        <h3>Problems and Resolution</h3>
        <img src = "img/poster.png" alt = "poster of the team's iteractive process that demonstrates materials and its use to incorporate into the final design">

            <p>
                The main constraint of the design team had been aligning the given materials to the needs of a disaster victim.
                As we had drawn clay and wood, the team found that it was incredibly difficult to incorporate, as these two materials were naturally very
                porous to begin with, and weren't necessarily the most secure material in a survival setting. This required research and as a result, we found ways to incorporating these
                elements into the design with function as a main premise. 
            </p>
        <h3>Evaluating the effectiveness</h3>

         <img src = "img/dimensions.png" alt = "mapping of dimensions for given design of the water bottle">

            <p>
            With the class being heavily material-focused, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding techniques proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution. 
            The project's design intent to appeal to the user, while simultaenously recognizing the restrictions of a manufacturing company
            revealed a need to adjust to change in an unfamiliar environment. After receiving insight by fellow mentors 
            the team learned to listen to the needs, motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.

        <section class="Template">

        <h2>Website Template</h2>

        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>When it comes to colours, I want to stay within a neutral colour palette to maintain a 
            minimalistic appearance. The two colours (light blue and cream) are included to complement the process analysis of the projects. 
            To further clarify, I would like the main pages, and any page that is not related to my projects a neutral colour palette,
            but when it comes to projects, I want to designate a specific colour to that page to build a stronger connection to the given project's aesthetic (further down the road i want to use and continue building this portfolio)
            For now, I would like the introduce colour to the nav bar however, and see how it goes, but may be changed for consistency in the page. 
       <div class = "colour-palette">
           
        <img src = "img/light-grey.png" alt = "image of light grey used for portfolio">
        <p>Light Grey: #DBDBDB</p>
        
        <img src = "img/dark-grey.png" alt = "image of light grey used for portfolio">
        <p>Dark Grey:#494848</p>

        <img src = "img/black.png" alt = "image of colour black ">
        <p>Black: #000000</p>

        
        <img id = "white" src = "img/white.png" alt = "image of colour white">
        <p>White:#ffffff</p>

        <img src = "img/cream.png" alt = "image of cream used for portfolio">
        <p>Cream:#dfd4c4</p>

        <img src = "img/light-blue.png" alt = "image of light blue used for portfolio">
        <p>Light Blue:#95a5eb</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Text</h3>
        <div class = "typeface">
            <p id = "sans-serif-1">Proxima Nova</p>
            <p id = "sans-serif-2">Helvetica</p>
            <p id = "sans-serif-3">Cambria</p>
        </div>

        <p> I want to incorporate Sans-serif to provide readability for users. Proxima Nova and Helvetica provide 
            opportunity to include bold dynamic typefaces into the website. Something that I want to incorporate into my website
            .As my portfolio contains a very neutral colour palette, I would like to focus on the design aspects of the website
            to demonstrate my design capabilities those who view the website.
        </p>
