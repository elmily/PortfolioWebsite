                <p>Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Emily and I'm a designer based in Vancouver with a focus in digital experience. I had the opportunity to gather experience in the industry as a specialist at Apple, 
            which has fostered my proactive approach in team work. I approach conflict with positive intent as the basis to communicating with my peers to collectively learn and grow together. With a diverse toolkit of skills,
            ranging from product design to user experience (UI/UX), I am confident in my skills to engage in teamwork and provide personalized solutions.
