        <h3>Analysis and Explanation</h3>

        <p>With the applications taught in IAT 343, the team sought to create an interactive website that
           demonstrated 3D modelling techniques and principles of Animation into the final project. Our 
           project Translink 2050 Envision, centers on the improvements Translink aims to bring to the public
           by the given date.The team viewed it as an opportunity to influence the viewing experience; we
           aimed to reveal information to users differently, and so enforced user interaction to contrast
           from traditional applications of 3D animation and modelling. With an interactive 3D transportation
           island as the landing page, users are greeted with transportation models that each have an integrated
           link leading to a unique 360-degree animated video that users can then view and interact with. 
        </p>

        <h3>Problems and Resolution</h3>
        <p> 
        One difficulty that we encountered while working on a 3D Modelling Software, such as Maya, was it's inability to feature collaborate editing. 
        Aligning with other team members turned out to be very difficult, as each individual's commitment to the project would be apparent in their individual
        files. As a result, discrepancies between the existing files would occur, and the team would need to reassemble all the necessary
        changes together. One benefit that came across animating in maya, was its ability to copy and paste keyframes to other files. With that in mind,
        the team was able to simultaneously work on rigging and animation, and although there were visual changes to the island, it did not affect
        the animation as long as it was in the same coordinate system as the previous files.
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluating the effectiveness</h3>
        <p>  As a part of the project's objective to visualize change from user experience, the design and work to assembling an interactive website, provided
        opportunities for users to interact with immersize experiences to help them get more familiar with the changes that are to come in the near future.
        I was involved in the concept and design of the website, providing users of an in-depth analysis and portrayal of Transporation in 2050.

        <h3>Analysis and Explanation</h3>
            <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO)
                that provided relief for victims of disasters and war. It required a focus on an uncommon material and common material that was drawn from a hat, and incorporated into the design. 
                With function and form being a main aspect into the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer in mind. My role 
                was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints
                in the involvement of materials. 
            </p>
        <h3>Problems and Resolution</h3>
        <img src = "img/poster.png" alt = "poster of the team's iteractive process that demonstrates materials and its use to incorporate into the final design">

            <p>
                The main constraint of the design team had been aligning the given materials to the needs of a disaster victim.
                As we had drawn clay and wood, the team found that it was incredibly difficult to incorporate, as these two materials were naturally very
                porous to begin with, and weren't necessarily the most secure material in a survival setting. This required research and as a result, we found ways to incorporating these
                elements into the design with function as a main premise. 
            </p>
        <h3>Evaluating the effectiveness</h3>

         <img src = "img/dimensions.png" alt = "mapping of dimensions for given design of the water bottle">

            <p>
            With the class being heavily material-focused, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding techniques proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution. 
            The project's design intent to appeal to the user, while simultaenously recognizing the restrictions of a manufacturing company
            revealed a need to adjust to change in an unfamiliar environment. After receiving insight by fellow mentors 
            the team learned to listen to the needs, motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Emily and I'm a designer based in Vancouver with a focus in digital experience. I had the opportunity to gather experience in the industry as a specialist at Apple, 
            which has fostered my proactive approach in team work. I approach conflict with positive intent as the basis to communicating with my peers to collectively learn and grow together. With a diverse toolkit of skills,
            ranging from product design to user experience (UI/UX), I am confident in my skills to engage in teamwork and provide personalized solutions.

        <h2>Website Template</h2>

        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>When it comes to colours, I want to stay within a neutral colour palette to maintain a 
            minimalistic appearance. The two colours (light blue and cream) are included to complement the process analysis of the projects. 
            To further clarify, I would like the main pages, and any page that is not related to my projects a neutral colour palette,
            but when it comes to projects, I want to designate a specific colour to that page to build a stronger connection to the given project's aesthetic (further down the road i want to use and continue building this portfolio)

        <p> I want to incorporate Sans-serif to provide readability for users</p>
