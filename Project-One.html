                <p>With the applications taught in IAT 343, the team sought to create an interactive website that
                    demonstrated 3D modelling techniques and principles of Animation into the final project. Our 
                    project Translink 2050 Envision, centers on the improvements Translink aims to bring to the public
                    by the given date.The team viewed it as an opportunity to influence the viewing experience; we
                    aimed to reveal information to users differently, and so enforced user interaction to contrast
                    from traditional applications of 3D animation and modelling. With an interactive 3D transportation
                    island as the landing page, users are greeted with transportation models that each have an integrated
                    link leading to a unique 360-degree animated video that users can then view and interact with.

                    One difficulty that we encountered while working on a 3D Modelling Software, such as Maya, was it's inability to feature collaborate editing. 
                    Aligning with other team members turned out to be very difficult, as each individual's commitment to the project would be apparent in their individual
                    files. As a result, discrepancies between the existing files would occur, and the team would need to reassemble all the necessary
                    changes together. One benefit that came across animating in maya, was its ability to copy and paste keyframes to other files. With that in mind,
                    the team was able to simultaneously work on rigging and animation, and although there were visual changes to the island, it did not affect
                    the animation as long as it was in the same coordinate system as the previous files.

            <p>  As a part of the project's objective to visualize change from user experience, the design and work to assembling an interactive website, provided
            opportunities for users to interact with immersize experiences to help them get more familiar with the changes that are to come in the near future.
            I was involved in the concept and design of the website, providing users of an in-depth analysis and portrayal of Transporation in 2050.
