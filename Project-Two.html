            <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO)
                that provided relief for victims of disasters and war.
                With function and form being a main aspect into the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer in mind. My role 
                was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints
                in the involvement of materials. </p>

            <p>As CLUO™ is premised with supporting human necessities, its 
                design aims to alleviate the frustrations of end users who are faced with a multitude
                of consequences from being victims of natural disasters. As there is a potential
                crisis to the availability of clean food and water, CLUO’s adjustable straps support users with a hands-free experience 
                providing convenience where mobility is necessary to survival. Moreover, with a detachable 
                cup found at the base of the bottle, it provides added functionality to protect, gather, 
                and share with the community.

            With the class being heavily focused in material usage, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding 
            techniques proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution to the given context.
            The project's design intent to appeal to the user, while simultaenously recognizing the motivations and frustrations of end-users
            drove the team to adjust and adhere to a user's need. After receiving insight by fellow mentors 
            the team learned to listen to the needs, motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.
