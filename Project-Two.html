            <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO)
                that provided relief for victims of disasters and war. It required a focus on an uncommon material and common material that was drawn from a hat, and incorporated into the design. 
                With function and form being a main aspect into the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer in mind. My role 
                was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints
                in the involvement of materials. </p>

                    <h2>Problems and Resolution.</h2>
                </div>
                <div class = "item-2">
                    <p> 
                      <p>
                The main constraint of the design team had been aligning the given materials to the needs of a disaster victim.
                As we had drawn clay and wood, the team found that it was incredibly difficult to incorporate, as these two materials were naturally very
                porous to begin with, and weren't necessarily the most secure material in a survival setting. This required research and as a result, we found ways to incorporating these
                elements into the design with function as a main premise.

            With the class being heavily material-focused, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding techniques proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution. 
            The project's design intent to appeal to the user, while simultaenously recognizing the restrictions of a manufacturing company
            revealed a need to adjust to change in an unfamiliar environment. After receiving insight by fellow mentors 
            the team learned to listen to the needs, motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.
