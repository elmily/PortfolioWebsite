        <h3> Main Paragraphs</h3>
      
        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Emily and I'm a designer based in Vancouver with a focus 
            in digital experience. I had the opportunity to gather experience in the industry as a specialist 
            at Apple, which has fostered my proactive approach in team work. I approach conflict with positive 
            intent as the basis to communicating with my peers to collectively learn and grow together. With a 
            diverse toolkit of skills, ranging from product design to user experience (UI/UX), I am confident 
            in my skills to engage in teamwork and provide personalized solutions</p>


        <h4>Analysis and Explanation Project One Paragraph</h4>
        <p>With the applications taught in IAT 343, the team sought to create an interactive website
           that demonstrated 3D modelling techniques and principles of Animation into the final project. 
           Our project Translink 2050 Envision, centers on the improvements Translink aims to bring to the 
           public by the given date.The team viewed it as an opportunity to influence the viewing experience; 
           we aimed to reveal information to users differently, and so enforced user interaction to contrast 
           from traditional applications of 3D animation and modelling. With an interactive 3D transportation 
           island as the landing page, users are greeted with transportation models that each have an integrated 
           link leading to a unique 360-degree animated video that users can then view and interact with.
        </p>


        <h4>Analysis and Explanation Project Two Paragraph</h4>
        <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged 
            to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO) that provided relief 
            for victims of disasters and war. It required a focus on an uncommon material and common material that 
            was drawn from a hat, and incorporated into the design. With function and form being a main aspect into 
            the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer 
            in mind. My role was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience 
            and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints 
            in the involvement of materials.</p>

        <h4>Problems and Resolution Project One Paragraph</h4>
        <p>One difficulty that we encountered while working on a 3D Modelling Software, such as Maya, 
            was it's inability to feature collaborate editing. Aligning with other team members turned out 
            to be very difficult, as each individual's commitment to the project would be apparent in their 
            individual files. As a result, discrepancies between the existing files would occur, and the team 
            would need to reassemble all the necessary changes together. One benefit that came across animating 
            in maya, was its ability to copy and paste keyframes to other files. With that in mind, the team was 
            able to simultaneously work on rigging and animation, and although there were visual changes to the 
            island, it did not affect the animation as long as it was in the same coordinate system as the previous files.
        </p>

        <h4>Problems and Resolution Project Two Paragraph</h4>
        <p>The main constraint of the design team had been aligning the given materials to the needs of a disaster 
            victim. As we had drawn clay and wood, the team found that it was incredibly difficult to incorporate, 
            as these two materials were naturally very porous to begin with, and weren't necessarily the most secure 
            material in a survival setting. This required research and as a result, we found ways to incorporating 
            these elements into the design with function as a main premise. </p>

        <h4>Evaluating the Effectiveness Project 1 Paragraph</h4>
        <p>As a part of the project's objective to visualize change from user experience, the design and work
           to assembling an interactive website, provided opportunities for users to interact with immersize experiences 
           to help them get more familiar with the changes that are to come in the near future. I was involved in the 
           concept and design of the website, providing users of an in-depth analysis and portrayal of Transporation in 2050.
        </p>

        <h4>Evaluating the Effectiveness Project 2 Paragraph</h4>
        <p>With the class being heavily material-focused, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding techniques 
            proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution. The project's design intent to appeal to the user, 
            while simultaenously recognizing the restrictions of a manufacturing company revealed a need to adjust to change 
            in an unfamiliar environment. After receiving insight by fellow mentors the team learned to listen to the needs, 
            motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.

        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>When it comes to colours, I want to stay within a neutral colour palette to maintain a 
            minimalistic appearance. The two colours (light blue and cream) are included to complement the process analysis of the projects. 
            To further clarify, I would like the main pages, and any page that is not related to my projects a neutral colour palette,
            but when it comes to projects, I want to designate a specific colour to that page to build a stronger connection to the given project's aesthetic (further down the road i want to use and continue building this portfolio)
            For now, I would like the introduce colour to the nav bar however, and see how it goes, but may be changed for consistency in the page. 
       <div class = "colour-palette">
           
        <img src = "img/light-grey.png" alt = "image of light grey used for portfolio">

        <img src = "img/dark-grey.png" alt = "image of light grey used for portfolio">

        <p> I want to incorporate Sans-serif to provide readability for users. Proxima Nova and Helvetica provide 
            opportunity to include bold dynamic typefaces into the website. Something that I want to incorporate into my website
            .As my portfolio contains a very neutral colour palette, I would like to focus on the design aspects of the website
            to demonstrate my design capabilities those who view the website.
