        <h3> Main Paragraphs</h3>
      
        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>I PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THROUGH VISUAL DESIGN, RAPID PROTOTYPING, AND REFINEMENT. </p>
            
         <p>Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Emily and I'm a designer based in Vancouver with a focus in digital experience who is interested in entering the UI/UX or Product Design Industry. I had the opportunity to gather experience in the industry as a specialist at Apple, 
                 which has fostered my proactive approach in team work. I approach conflict with positive intent as the basis to communicating with my peers to collectively learn and grow together. With a diverse toolkit of skills,
                 ranging from product design to user experience (UI/UX), I am confident in my skills to engage in teamwork and provide personalized solutions.  
                </p>

        <h4>Analysis and Explanation Project One Paragraph</h4>
        <p>With the applications taught in IAT 343, the team sought to create an interactive website
           that demonstrated 3D modelling techniques and principles of Animation into the final project. 
           Our project Translink 2050 Envision, centers on the improvements Translink aims to bring to the 
           public by the given date.The team viewed it as an opportunity to influence the viewing experience; 
           we aimed to reveal information to users differently, and so enforced user interaction to contrast 
           from traditional applications of 3D animation and modelling. With an interactive 3D transportation 
           island as the landing page, users are greeted with transportation models that each have an integrated 
           link leading to a unique 360-degree animated video that users can then view and interact with.
        </p>


        <h4>Analysis and Explanation Project Two Paragraph</h4>
           <p> After numerous hands-on experience with materials in design, the design team had been challenged to design a water purification artifact for a non-governmental organization (NGO)
                that provided relief for victims of disasters and war.
                With function and form being a main aspect into the development of a product, the team strove to understand branding with the experience of a consumer in mind. My role 
                was to model and build the visual design. This included understanding user experience and prototyping through a personalized solution to victims of disasters and war despite the constraints
                in the involvement of materials. </p>
          
        
        <h4>Problems and Resolution Project One Paragraph</h4>
        <p>One difficulty that we encountered while working on a 3D Modelling Software, such as Maya, 
            was it's inability to feature collaborate editing. Aligning with other team members turned out 
            to be very difficult, as each individual's commitment to the project would be apparent in their 
            individual files. As a result, discrepancies between the existing files would occur, and the team 
            would need to reassemble all the necessary changes together. One benefit that came across animating 
            in maya, was its ability to copy and paste keyframes to other files. With that in mind, the team was 
            able to simultaneously work on rigging and animation, and although there were visual changes to the 
            island, it did not affect the animation as long as it was in the same coordinate system as the previous files.
        </p>

        <h4>Problems and Resolution Project Two Paragraph</h4>
     <p>As CLUO™ is premised with supporting human necessities, its 
                design aims to alleviate the frustrations of end users who are faced with a multitude
                of consequences from being victims of natural disasters. As there is a potential
                crisis to the availability of clean food and water, CLUO’s adjustable straps support users with a hands-free experience 
                providing convenience where mobility is necessary to survival. Moreover, with a detachable 
                cup found at the base of the bottle, it provides added functionality to protect, gather, 
                and share with the community.
            </p>

        <h4>Evaluating the Effectiveness Project 1 Paragraph</h4>
        <p>As a part of the project's objective to visualize change from user experience, the design and work
           to assembling an interactive website, provided opportunities for users to interact with immersize experiences 
           to help them get more familiar with the changes that are to come in the near future. I was involved in the 
           concept and design of the website, providing users of an in-depth analysis and portrayal of Transporation in 2050.
        </p>

        <h4>Evaluating the Effectiveness Project 2 Paragraph</h4>
           <p>
            With the class being heavily focused in material usage, prescribing the correct fabrication and bonding 
            techniques proved to be a challenge in providing a correct solution to the given context.
            The project's design intent to appeal to the user, while simultaenously recognizing the motivations and frustrations of end-users
            drove the team to adjust and adhere to a user's need. After receiving insight by fellow mentors 
            the team learned to listen to the needs, motivations, and frustrations of a user to shape our final design.

        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>When it comes to colours, I want to stay within a neutral colour palette to maintain a 
            minimalistic appearance. The two shades of black and white I've decided to incorporate is slightly blue toned with the consideration of the user experience
            in mind. Instead of using soolid #000000 and #ffffff (pure black and white) which can easily strain the eyes, I have chosen an off white and black
            to ensure that the sharp constrast does not easily tire the eyes.

            .As my portfolio contains a very neutral colour palette, I would like to focus on the design aspects of the website
            to demonstrate my capabilities towards those who view the website.
